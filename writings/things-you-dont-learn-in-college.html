						<h2>The reality disconnect</h2>

								<p>There are a lot of <i>things</i> you don’t learn in college. For one, you’re never really held accountable (unless god forbid you’re an honest to goodness hard-working engineering major) for anything. Miss class (or all of them), cheat on an exam (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/20/sports/ncaafootball/notre-dame-is-rocked-by-charges-of-academic-cheating.html">you’d have to be a pretty stupid student athlete to get caught</a>), or somehow end up in the hospital after one too many (or possibly way, way too many) drinks, it all doesn’t matter. There’s a lot of things we got away with in college. Not so much in the real world.</p>

								<p>Staring out of the window, I gazed upon a half-frozen bleak urban landscape (Detroit in March in other words). Clearly there’d be no distraction to get caught up into happening in this barren, empty wastes of the massive throughways Detroit called streets. In a quite serious discussion with my immediate supervisor, I heard the words spoken, “we need a decision now”. There were many thoughts buzzing around in my mind; I so wanted to badly think about all of those, instead of the one being pressed into my brain. Gathering the courage to rotate my body to face my colleague, I looked up and asked, “how long do I have?”</p><br>
								<p>There are many things you don’t learn in college. One of those things is learning how to understand how to appreciate what you’re doing. And how to appreciate it enough to be able to know when it’s time to walk away and do something else. In college, it’s too easy to screw up one test, but make it up on the next one. Drop the class, with no penalty, before that first failed test ends on your transcript. I swear that my Finance professor bumped up my Intro to Finance grade to a B-, simply due to me being a nice guy and actually showing up to his class as a second semester senior. It’s also ironic being a business major and taking finance that late into my college career.</p>

						<h3>Lofty Ambitions</h3>
						<div class="row">
							<section class="column">
								<p>I had left college with incredibly lofty and idealistic ambitions. Thankfully, I have those today, but I’ve come out of the past year a bit more jaded and worn. Majoring in Entrepreneurship really doesn’t give someone a lot of choices professionally. Lucky for me, I had done some amatuer web freelancing, so I knew my way around technology somewhat. I knew only one thing after graduation, I wanted take the fast track to understanding everything there was to entrepreneurship. I had even bet my short term future on a fellowship program that promised exactly that on paper. Interning at everything from government consulting to software-as-a-service software in Silicon Valley let me to believe I knew more than I really knew. None of that prepared me for what was to come in the year after graduating.</p>
								<p>One of the largest benefits of joining this fellowship program, was that it helped fellows find jobs with up and coming startups. The catch being that these companies were typically located in “second-tier” cities, think of Detroit or Cleveland. “Cool, not a problem” I must have thought at the time when I accepted a quick offer with my first company in Detroit. After sitting through two years of Entrepreneurship major classes with the objective to write business plans and “action plans”, I really had no idea what working at a real startup would be like. Teaching entrepreneurship is fundamentally impossible, let alone being able to convey the experience of working at one without actually doing that. The fact that entrepreneurship is no longer a major at my alma matter would attest to that difficulty.</p>

								<p>As I sat there in that padded mini-conference room, that served as a rude awakening call, I must have realized I had learned a lot in the past eight or nine months. I had grown a lot in my professional skill sets, namely design and front-end development, but had really failed to achieve my larger ambitions. Something that should have taken a lot less time to realize. Sitting in that room, the thought must have crossed my mind that in college there’s always someone to appeal to for help</p>

						<h3>The slow acceptance</h3>
						<div class="row">
							<section class="column columns">
								<p>Let’s say your American History professor didn’t quite like the direction and thesis of your last paper. If you were to come schedule a time to talk with him and nicely ask for a second chance, he’d probably give it to you. This is something incredibly untrue in real life. There’s always someone to talk to, but they really don’t have to do anything about it. Neither does your American History professor, but generally they’re not there to be mean or make your life (too much) harder. At some point, you are your best advocate.</p><br>
								<p>They were right of course. Even if I had brought up the fact that I wasn’t happy months beforehand, what had I really done to try to change the fate that led me to that padded mini-conference room? Of course, I had other things pressing on my conscious, health issues included. But, that’s not important. For some reason, I was initially flabbergasted that I was being asked to make a choice. A choice that would decide my future at that company. I think being raised in an environment where you stick out like a sore thumb everywhere, really made it hard for me to pretend to really enjoy doing things when I really did not. </p>

								<p>Looking back, it’s incredibly obvious. If I wasn’t happy doing what I was doing, and if it wasn’t going to change, this situation would have to occur. As acceptance slowly settled into my thought-waves, my colleague and I talked about options I might have in the near future.</p>
								<p>The next day I sat down in front of the same colleague and both founders. I remember feeling squirmish and rightfully out of my mind. I have never had this discussion before with anyone. I could think of no parallel experience from all of my education. Clearly, the meeting went alright as I didn’t suffer a mental breakdown on the spot, and we came out with the best possible outcome for the situation. I never had to bargain before in my life, especially in college. If there was a situation I wanted to avoid, I’d just not go to that class that day. Negotiating leaving my job was definitely a first for me. But, I am proud of the fact that no bridges were burned that day. I would wrap the next few weeks up, turn in a project, and walk out still as friends.</p>

						<h3>Of things to come</h3>
						<div class="row">
							<section class="column text">
								<p>The next few months were an incredible blur of health issues, job seeking, and trying to understand what I just done. Ultimately, I did find another job at another startup in Detroit. Life goes on, whether you go with it or not. The moral of this story is perhaps that we were given way too much time to be wishy-washy in college. Do I like this major or not? Well, you’ve got until the end of sophomore year to decide that. Real life has boundaries and consequences. The sooner I understood that, and begun to internalize that, the happier and more satisfied I became. Utlimately, we have to just make a choice sometimes. My dad likes to always say, “half of the game, is just showing up”. </p>
